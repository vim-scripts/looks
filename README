This is a vim plugin I created for myself to help me manage various *looks* of vim. Each look is dictionary of settings and options that makes vim get a unique look.

These looks are defined in vimrc (or somewhere else but are source-d) like the following,

    let g:looks = {}
    let g:looks.dark = {
        \ '_map': "d",
        \ 'colorscheme': "lucius",
        \ 'guifont': "Inconsolata\\ Medium\\ 15",
        \ 'cursorline': 1
        \ }
    let g:looks.light = { "colorscheme": "tango" }

and the looks can be loaded with :Look command, like so

    :Look dark

Tab completion is also available on the command line for all available looks.
